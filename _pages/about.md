I'm currently a PhD candidate in ECEE at Arizona State University, under the co-supervision of [Prof. Junshan Zhang](http://informationnet.asu.edu/) and [Prof. Lei Ying](https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/). I received my B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2013, and my M.S. degree in Telecommunications from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2014.
